# AI Guidance

This file provides guidance to LLMs and other AI agents when working with code in this repository.

General guidance for all contributors, including synthetic ones, can be found in sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.contributors.general-guidance.md

Look into the sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.contributors.djradon.ai-guidance.md for djradon's personal guidance.

Refinement of .ai-guidance, general-guidance, and personal guidance should be an ongoing process. Continually check that guidance is up-to-date, and offer suggestions for improvement whenever possible.

## Documentation Driven Development

- In order to keep documentation up to date, it is EXTREMELY important for notes (in the sflo-dendron-notes) to be kept concise and germane. Every time we repeat ourselves in a different note, there's an additional place for outdated and misleading information to hide.
- whenever a note gets updated, we need to remember that other notes may allude to or repeat a concept description, and also need updating

## Process Rules

- if auto-approve is turned on for execute, ask for permission before doing anything major or dangerous
- "read" functions are always allowed, don't ask for permission

## Technical Tips

- check your current working directory before you compose file-related commands
